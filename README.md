# FriendBot

Hi there!

I am a bot which is going to help you to make new friends!
Before we begin make sure that you have a profile. In other case create it by command /start

You can here:
1) Check your profile: /check_profile
2) Edit your profile: /check_profile -> press button "Edit"
3) Find a new friend: /check_profile -> press button "Find a new friend"
3.1) Send friend-request: press button "🤝 friend request"
3.2) Check next profile: press button "👎 next"
4) You can find contacts of all your friends: /friend-list
5) You check current status of your friend-requests: /requested_list

If you send a friend-request recipient will be notified and able to send a reply

If you received a friend-request senders profile will be shown to you next in "Find a new friend" section

If you accept a friend-request then I will send you both contacts of each other'
